# Staff Attendance System

## Project Description

The Staff Attendance System is a mobile application designed to streamline and secure the process of marking attendance for university staff. The application leverages facial recognition and fingerprint scanning to ensure accurate and reliable attendance tracking. Additionally, the app enforces connectivity to the university's Wi-Fi and verifies the IP address to prevent unauthorized access.

Key features include:

- **Facial Recognition**: Uses a machine learning model to recognize faces for attendance.
- **Fingerprint Scanning**: Allows staff to mark attendance using fingerprint verification.
- **Wi-Fi and IP Verification**: Ensures the device is connected to the university's Wi-Fi and checks the IP address for security.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration process for users.
- **Attendance Reports**: Provides detailed attendance reports.
- **Profile Management**: Allows users to manage their profile information.
